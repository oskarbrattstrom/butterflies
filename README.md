Butterfly ebooks Beta testing site

Please register yourself as a user by sending an email to oskar.brattstrom.butterflies@gmail.com This means you will get an email everytime updated guides are published. 

These butterfly field guides are aimed for amateurs working in the field in Nigeria. They do not contain all species, but instead focus on common species and species easy to recognise. 

The guides on this page are for Beta Testing only, the final guides will be made available on www.bicyclus.se in a near future.

Generally there is one page per species (or group of similar species) with clickable links marked in blue. For some species there is further information below what is visible on the first screen, and this can be reached by scrolling the page down. In these cases there will be an icon at the bottom of the page informing that extra content is available below. 

To use the EPUB files you need to install a EPUB reader app on your phone. 

For iPhones the 'Books' app preinstalled with iOS should do the trick. 

For Android phones most epub readers will distort the layout. The best free app tested to date where full functionality is retained is 'Reasily' that can be found on Google Play. A screenshot shwoing the Reasily app is available as 'Reasily.jpg'

To open the guides on your phone you will need to store them somewhere on the phone or download them from your own cloud service. I wont be able to assist with individual queries on how to get the apps to work as I am not a phone expert.
