These butterfly field guides are aimed for amateurs working in the field in Nigeria. They do not contain all species but instead focus on common species and species easy to recognise. 

Generally there is one page per species (or group of similar species) with clickable links marked in blue. For some species there is further information below what is visible on the first screen that can be reached by scrolling the page down. IN these cases there will be an icon at the bottom of the page informing that extra content is available. 

To use the epub style files you need to install a ebup reader app on your phone. 

For iPhones the 'Books' app preinstalled with iOS should do the trick. 

For Android phones most epub readers will distort the layout. The best free app tested to date where full functionality is retained is 'Reasily' that can be found on Google Play.
